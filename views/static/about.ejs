                    <p>
                      I am Christopher Ong. I am a Singaporean and married with one daughter. I was graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Science (major in Computer Science).<br /><br />

                      I started off my career as a programmer and was working on IBM mid-range computer System/36, AS/400 and RS6000 using programming languages like RPG and Cobol for almost 16 years. Then I moved on as project coordinator and stopped doing programming for the last ten years.<br /><br />

                      I would like to embark on software development again. It has always been my passion in doing software programming. I always enjoy the process of building up programs from nothing and deliver the end product to the users. There is a sense of achievement and great excitement.<br /><br />

                      I am a hardworking, determined, logical and analytical person. I am able to translate user's requirements into workable computer software solution. This is what I enjoy most.<br /><br />

                      I like to play jigsaw puzzles, reading, listen to music and singing. For sport I play basketball and love jogging.<br /><br />
